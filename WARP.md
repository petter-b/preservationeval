# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

Continuous learning and improvement
- Always keep this WARP.md (and any subdirectory WARP.md files), other Markdown files as well as Global Rules updated. As soon as a new pattern or practice is established, add it to the relevant document and/or to Rules. Review templates/ and docs/ periodically to keep guidance and templates aligned.
- Connesouly review the documentation to make sure it does not grow out of hand. Make sure to not just add new items but also remove items which are not needed anymore and/or consolidate similar information. Make sure that the documentation is clear and easy to understand and structured to allow easy navigation.

Project overview
- A typed Python package that re-implements the Image Permanence Institute’s dew point calculator (dpcalc.org) and related preservation metrics (PI, EMC, mold risk). Lookup tables are fetched from dpcalc.org and converted to a Python module during build/install.

Development setup
- Python >= 3.11
- Install dev extras and set up hooks:
  - pip install -e ".[dev]"
  - pre-commit install

Common commands
- Format and lint
  - ruff format .
  - ruff check .
  - ruff check . --fix  # apply safe autofixes
- Type checking
  - mypy .
- Run tests (pytest is configured via pyproject)
  - pytest                 # runs with mypy plugin and coverage (per addopts)
  - pytest -q              # quieter
  - pytest -k "pattern"    # run tests by expression
  - pytest tests/test_core.py::test_name  # run a single test
- Markers (declared in pyproject/conftest): unit, integration, validation, slow
  - pytest -m "unit"
  - pytest -m "not slow and not validation"
- Coverage
  - pytest --cov
- Generate validation test data (compares Python vs the original JS)
  - python -m tests.validate_core                   # prepares tests/data, runs JS + Python comparison
  - pytest tests/test_validation.py                 # only validation tests
  - pytest tests/test_validation.py --force-update  # refresh cached JS cases
  - Note: Requires Node.js + npm (puppeteer is specified in package.json)
- Lookup table generation (manual)
  - python -m scripts.generate_tables
  - Normally triggered automatically during build/install.
- Build and local install
  - python -m build
  - pip install dist/*.whl

Big-picture architecture
- Build-time table generation pipeline
  - setup.py defines CustomBuildPy and CustomInstall. During build, preservationeval.install.generate_tables.generate_tables is invoked to:
    1) Download dp.js from dpcalc.org
    2) Parse metadata and raw arrays (preservationeval.install.parse + patterns)
    3) Construct typed LookupTable instances (PITable, EMCTable, MoldTable)
    4) Emit a module preservationeval/tables.py (install.export) with initialized tables and an _INITIALIZED flag
  - Versioning: setup.CustomDistribution writes/reads src/preservationeval/_version.py and derives the package version from git tags when available. pyproject sets version dynamic from preservationeval.__version__.
- Runtime modules
  - preservationeval.core_functions: Public API for PI, EMC, and mold(t, rh); uses the generated tables and validates inputs via util_functions
  - preservationeval.eval_functions: Maps numeric outputs to EnvironmentalRating (GOOD/OK/RISK) for natural aging, mechanical damage, mold growth, metal corrosion
  - preservationeval.util_functions: Helpers such as validate_rh/temp, to_celsius, calculate_dew_point
  - preservationeval.types: Domain types (Annotated), exceptions, and the generic LookupTable implementation with boundary handling and rounding semantics compatible with the JS reference
  - preservationeval.utils: Structured logging setup and safe path utilities used by installer and tests
- Tests and validation
  - pytest configured via pyproject (testpaths, markers, mypy plugin, coverage). tests/validate_core orchestrates cross-language validation by running the JS in a headless browser (puppeteer), caching inputs/outputs under tests/data. Use --force-update to refresh against latest dp.js
- Scripts
  - scripts/generate_tables.py: Convenience wrapper to regenerate tables on demand
  - scripts/update_test_data.py: Refresh validation cases by driving ValidationTest

CI and releases (reference)
- .github/workflows/python-cicd.yml runs pre-commit and pytest across Python 3.11–3.13, uploads coverage, and supports two release modes:
  - Release Candidate: builds with a PEP 440 rc version and optionally uploads to TestPyPI
  - Production Release: version bumped from latest tag, builds, uploads to PyPI, verifies install, and creates a GitHub Release
- CodeQL and a scheduled pre-commit autoupdate workflow are present.

Branch management and releases
- Main branch is protected: all changes must go through pull requests
- Use squash merge for feature branches (per project preference)
- Pre-commit hooks include no-commit-to-branch protection for main
- To merge: create PR, get approval, use `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`
- Version validation workflow prevents invalid releases in CI

Troubleshooting common issues
- Pre-commit hook path issues: If hook points to wrong interpreter (e.g., devcontainer path):
  1. Ensure .venv exists: `python3 -m venv .venv`
  2. Install dev dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
  3. Reinstall hooks: `pre-commit install -f`
  4. Verify: `head -n 6 .git/hooks/pre-commit` should show correct .venv path
- Pre-commit failing on main branch: Use `--no-verify` only for legitimate squash merges
- Hook validation: Run `pre-commit run --from-ref origin/main --to-ref HEAD` before PR

Notes for future agents
- Tests relying on the JS reference require network access to download dp.js and a working Node.js + npm for puppeteer execution. The standard unit/integration suite runs fine without Node.
- When making assumptions, validate with proper tests to prove correctness

Continuous learning and improvement
Always keep this and other more specific WARP.md as well as global Rules updated. As soon as a new pattern or practice is established, it should be added to the relevant WARP.md file and/or to Rules. Note also the "Template and updates" section that is very important also for WARP.md files.

When committing changes, make sure that relevant documentation (md-files) are kept updated and accurate.
